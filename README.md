# Node Farm

This is a node express application with dynamic templating using pug engine. I build the same app before with native node code (without express framework) here in this [repo](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-node-bootcamp).

## Usage

```bash
# Intall application dependencies
npm install

# Start application sever
npm start
```

## License

The design of this application belongs to Jonas Schmedtmann in his complete Node JS bootcamp. You can find his repo [here](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-node-bootcamp).
